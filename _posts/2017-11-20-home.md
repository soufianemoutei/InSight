Insight is a Mindstorms EV3 autonomous robot designed to make cartographies.

The robot explores a given arena by picking his way through the obstacles and finally sends to a server a map illustrating the scanned area in at most 4 minutes.

This work was developed as part of a school project for the 2017 Fall course entitled Operating Systems at EURECOM.

Its name was chosen as a reference to NASA’s Mars rover mission that will be launched in 2018 and that aims to realize the cartography of a certain region of the red planet.
