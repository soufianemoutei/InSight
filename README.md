# InSight

Insight is a Mindstorms EV3 autonomous robot designed to make cartographies.

The robot explores a given arena by picking his way through the obstacles and finally sends to a server a map illustrating the scanned area in at most 4 minutes.

This work was developed as part of a school project for the 2017 Fall course entitled Operating Systems at EURECOM.
